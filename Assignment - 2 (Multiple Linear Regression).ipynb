    "###Assignment 2: Predicting Car Fuel Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "####**Problem Statement**\n",
    "Car manufacturers and buyers are interested in understanding how various car features affect fuel efficiency. This model will predict a car's fuel efficiency (miles_per_gallon) based on horsepower, engine_size, and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "####**How the Model Will Help**\n",
    "The model can help car manufacturers optimize designs for better fuel efficiency, and car buyers can better evaluate vehicles based on their performance characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "####**Data Description**\n",
    "The dataset contains four columns:\n",
    "- horsepower: Engine power output in horsepower.\n",
    "- engine_size: Engine displacement in liters.\n",
    "- weight: Car weight in pounds.\n",
    "- miles_per_gallon: Fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Instructions**\n",
    "- Model Training: Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and train a multiple linear regression model using horsepower, engine_size, and weight as predictors for miles_per_gallon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Do you think if scaling is necessary for horsepower, engine_size, and weight?**\n"
